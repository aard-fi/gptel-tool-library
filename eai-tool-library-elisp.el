;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This provides LLM access to some information for efficient automated elisp
;; editing. This is building on the buffer module - and generally should be
;; doable with just the buffer module, but especially LLMs with a small context
;; window might prefer having specialised tools operating on smaller context.
