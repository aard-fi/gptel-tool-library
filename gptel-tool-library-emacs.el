;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This module contains some safe modules useful for gathering various data from
;; emacs. For potentially destructive tools as well as for elisp development
;; support see the `elisp' module.

;;; Code:

(require 'gptel-tool-library)

(defvar gptel-tool-library-emacs-tools '()
  "The list of emacs related tools")
;; we skip the other two variables as this module should only contain safe tools
